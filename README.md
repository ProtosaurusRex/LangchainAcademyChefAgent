This directory contains the ChefAgent project, which demonstrates the use of AI agents for recipe and cooking assistance using Python and LangChain.

## Project Structure
- `ChefAgent.py`: Main script for the ChefAgent functionality.
- `ChefAgentSL.py`: Supporting logic for the ChefAgent.
- `ChefAgentProject.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the repository and navigate to this directory:

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd GitHubStage
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (.venv)
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

#### On Windows:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Project
- To run the main script:
  ```sh
  python ChefAgent.py
  ```
- To explore the notebook, open `ChefAgentProject.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab or VS Code.

## Notes
- Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- Update `requirements.txt` as needed when adding new dependencies.
